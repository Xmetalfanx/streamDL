This is my attempt at using ffmpeg to download streaming content.  I have had success with this but it depends on what stream URL you pick ... you may get different 403 related errors not picked correctedly 

What Helps:
    - [Stream Detector (Firefox Addon)](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/hls-stream-detector/)
    - [HLS Downloader (Chrome Addon)](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/hls-downloader/apomkbibleomoihlhhdbeghnfioffbej?hl=en)
